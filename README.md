# Call Center BI Dashboard
## Project Overview

This project involves the creation of a comprehensive Business Intelligence (BI) dashboard in Power BI. The dashboard is designed to reflect key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics crucial for effectively managing call center operations and improving overall performance.

## Key Features
### 1. Overall Customer Satisfaction

    * Displays the average customer satisfaction score.
    * Helps in understanding the quality of service provided.

### 2. Overall Calls Answered/Abandoned

    * Shows the total number of calls answered and abandoned.
    * Provides insights into call center efficiency and customer wait times.

### 3. Calls by Time

    * Visualizes the volume of calls received at different times of the day.
    * Aids in resource planning and identifying peak call times.

### 4. Average Speed of Answer

    * Measures the average time taken to answer a call.
    * Essential for assessing responsiveness and reducing customer wait times.

### 5. Agentâ€™s Performance Quadrant

    * Plots agents based on average handle time (talk duration) vs. calls answered.
    * Highlights top performers and identifies areas for improvement.


## Dashboard Design

The dashboard is designed with a user-friendly interface, ensuring that anyone can easily access and interpret the data. Visualizations include bar charts, line graphs, and scatter plots, providing a clear and concise representation of the metrics.

### Data Sources

    * Call Logs: Includes data on call times, duration, and outcomes.
    * Customer Feedback: Contains customer satisfaction scores and comments.

### Tools Used

    * Power BI: For creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.
    * Excel: For data preprocessing and cleaning.
